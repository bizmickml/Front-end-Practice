        <header> This is the header element which generally includes the site name or title and a navbar
            <nav>this is a nav which is meant to contain the navigation elements on the page but really can contain just about anything
                <ul>This is an unorderd list which means it's a list with no numbers
                    <li>This is one list item</li>

                <h5>Header FIVE</h5>
                <h6>Header SIX - as you can see, headers are automoatically sized which can make styling easier or more difficult depending on your goals</h6>
                <p>Paragragh - there are no subheading or tagline elements so we just use a p element with an appropriate class</p>
                <p>Another paragragh.  You can write as much as you want inside one of these elements.  Even if it takes up multiple lines or even multiple pages.  If it takes up multiple lines, it will just wrap like this.</p>
                <hr />
                <p>There's another element above this paragraph element which is used as a separator.  It's the hr element, but you can't write in it</p>
                <article>the article element represents content that is meant to be a self-contained composition within a document</article>
                <aside>aside is used to notate content that is only indirectly related to the main content of a document</aside>
                <div>this is a div element, just a blank element you can use for pretty much anything</div>
                <img alt="this is an image element which needs an src address to display.  What you're reading is the alt content of the image element"/>
                <br />
                <p>above, there is a br element which creates a line break in text</p>

                <h3 class="no-format">Here's some examples of "inline" items which can all be displayed as block if desired</h3>
                <p>This is a p element <span class="no-format inline">with a span element nested inside.</span> Usually you would use a span to section off some text that will be styled differently than the rest of the text that it is nested in</p>
                <p>This is a p element <a class="no-format inline">with an anchor element nested inside.</a> Usually you would use an anchor element for a link.  Anchor elements can also "surround" other elements to create any sort of link you want but you have to change the display style to block instead of inline</p>
                <p>This is a p element <em class="no-format inline">with an em element nested inside. em stands for emphasis</em> this one's obvious I think</p>
                <p>This is a p element <strong class="no-format inline">with a strong element nested inside. "strong" makes the text bold.</strong>  And here's the rest of the paragraph.</p>
                <form>

<! ---- Form elements have an 'onsubmit' attribute
        if not set the form submits the data and refreshes the page
        you can change this by telling the form to do something else 
        call a javascript function like this:
            onsubmit="function() return false;"  
            'return false:' stops the form from refreshing the page

<! ---- labels use the 'for' attribute to link with the input they are the label for
        the input 'name' is what is linked with the answer when the data is collected
        like the key to a key value pair in an object
